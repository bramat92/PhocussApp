# ProjectCS246

Project files for an app called Phocus that will help users set goals, track progress, and use time wisely and productively.
This app will be ideal for students, teachers, other professionals, self-starters, and those who struggle with productivity and time-management.

*This app is a student project through Brigham Young University-Idaho, and will not be monetized unless it is desired to move forward after the semester project period end.
